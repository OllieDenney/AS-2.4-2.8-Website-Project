# AS-2.4-2.8-Website-Project

This website is meant to represent what a Cyber-Secruity website is meant to look like, 
it is basically a mock website for a cyber-secruity business. This website is targeted 
towards people/businesses looking for cyber-secruity solutions. This website utilises 
some Google plug-ins, therefore to run the website properly you need to be connected to 
internet, otherwise some features may look different or not work. I also recommend to 
open index.html first as this is the home page for the site.
